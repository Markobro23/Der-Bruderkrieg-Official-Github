##Constitutional Republic of China
zhang_shizhao_desc:0 "Born March 20th, 1881, President Zhang Shizhao is a native of Hunan province - the birthplace of revolutionary ideals in China. He formed early attachments to Huang Xing, the venerated founder of the Republic; as a teenager Zhang was among the first members in the Huaxing Society, an anti-Qing organization. Its goals were a socially conservative republican nation, and its members were anti-Qing and pro-democracy. It was established in 1893, a period of national turmoil, and just in time to act.\n\nWith Wu Dacheng's 1895 assassination, which the Huaxing and other groups denied any part in, the People's Revival (or Restoration) Movement began to consume southwest China, and then the rest of the newly 'liberated' territories.\nThe people, dissatisfied with the former Qing governors whose policies seemed barely different from Beijing's, let their voices be heard; Huang Xing was chosen as their leader. With the skillful employment of both paid mercenary groups and pragmatic utilization of esoteric societies, he managed to carve out what appeared a genuine popular democracy amongst China's other dysfunctional political climates.\n\nZhang Shizhao himself, as his protegé, was a naturally ascendant political leader. He edited the Jia Yin magazine, committed to the people's involvement in politics, and impressed people with his strong convictions of traditional Chinese customs in a modern, republican framework. By forging a strong friendship and political alliance with Chen Duxiu, the magazine's assistant editor, Zhang impressed his peers with a willingness to compromise for the good of the country.\n\nPresiding over negotiations with the Americans to secure aid was a risky gamble, but his demonstration that - in moderation - the country could endure it ended up winning him even greater popularity.\nHuang Xing's 1913 retirement from the presidency opened up the opportunity for Zhang's candidacy, and he has presided over the Republic with a steady hand for the past two decades. Still, some mutter that such a conservative government cannot really fulfill the revolutionary principles the country was founded on; Zhang's old friend Chen Duxiu has been seen less and less at the Changsha government residence..."

##Great Ming
chenghua_desc:0 "Born in 1882, Zhu Yuxun - the man who would become the Chenghua Emperor - began life as a near-destitute heir to a useless name. The descendants of the conquered Ming dynasty had been made nobles by the Qing in an ancient custom, given the title "Marquis of Extended Grace" as a hereditary role in 1725. However, while elevating them socially, this in fact did little for their actual situation; Zhu Zhilian, the first recipient, could only barely claim descent and lived as a minor provincial magistrate. All this changed with the People's Restoration (or Revival) Movement of 1895.\n\nThe Tiandihui, or Heaven and Earth Society, sponsored Zhu's claim to the throne. Securing Guangxi and Guangdong, their ragged forces of gangs, religious sects, and guerilla fighters pushed up towards the crucial city then known as Jiangning, renamed to Yingtian in honor of the former Ming capital. As they cried out to "Overthrow the Qing; restore the Ming!" the people started to believe that a new kind of imperial governance could be just what they needed. Seizing the lands bordering treaty ports along the way, the Ming developed a pragmatic approach to foreign influence, accepting that westernization was simply a reality they needed to accomplish - culminating in their acceptance of American governance of Shanghai, and the subsequent treaties establishing this dynamic (though initially the result of a Beijing-Washington deal).\n\nStill, despite what seemed like incredible success for the newly-restored Great Ming, an informed observer could sense problems looming. Xie Zantai's faction, who had launched the initial revolt, began to clash with the Tiandihui; while Xie won the power struggle, the Tiandihui eventually began to seep back in to society. Now, the Chenghua Emperor must live up to his name and "accomplish change" for the country to thrive, moving beyond his current status as a practical puppet to scheming court factions. Xie is aging, the people grow restless, and gangs have begun to act against government directives.\nAnd the Tiandihui never forgot Xie's 1900 purge..."

MNG_spurious_claim_desc:0 "Zhu Yuxun may have declared himself the Chenghua Emperor, celebrating his "accomplished change," but a realistic look - or any look - at the situation reveals him to be Emperor in name only. He does not control the walls of the Forbidden City, and his power rests upon the loyalty of furtive sects, criminal gangs, and scheming court factions. Furthermore, as a leader who permitted the political exile of some of his crucial supporters, his credibility is rather low; this is not helped by the Yellow Sand Society acting in his name across the border to the north. Though their goals align, curtailing their activities would increase his status as a legitimate contender for the Dragon Throne.\nSoon he must make a play for Beijing, or risk the lands he presides over slipping from his grasp. But is the army truly ready?"

##Qing Empire
zhengjie_desc:0 "Born April 16th, 1907, Pujie was initially passed over by his uncle Zaitian (the Guangxu Emperor) in favor of the older Puyi. However, as time went on, it became apparent even at a young age that Pujie was simply better-equipped to rule; the immature Puyi reveled in flogging his eunuchs for even the smallest annoyance, could speak not a word of Manchu, and was regarded as a menace by his family and tutors. Pujie, by contrast, was a studious boy who seemed to exemplify Confucian virtues and have an inquisitive mind, open to Western thought. This was much more the kind of man who seemed suited to rule over a post-War of National Salvation empire, one which had given away Shanghai and Tianjin to foreign powers against its people's wishes.\n\nIn 1916, when Pujie was nine, he began to receive the education of a future emperor (though no official declaration was made). In a practically unprecedented step for one who would assume the throne, he studied foreign languages extensively and learned Japanese at a Tokyo school as well as German with a private tutor from Vienna; foreign observers remarked that Pujie was quick-witted and a charming host. With his uncle's death in 1934, Pujie was declared the heir and now emperor of the Great Qing.\n\nTaking the era name "Zhengjie," meaning "to open one's eyes and see the world," his reign is widely considered to be the new peak of a much-diminished empire. The lands his uncle and preceding emperors ruled over are now split amongst many contending factions; his own legitimacy is questioned both by radical republicans unsatisfied with the current parliamentary system and restorationist military officers seeking to use his name for their own ends. Pu Jie to the Manchu nobles, Pujie to the Han Chinese he rules over, and the Zhengjie Emperor in chronicles of his times; he is all things to all people, and no one - including himself - knows what direction the state his forefathers made will take next."

##Xibei Sultanate
ma_buqing_desc:0 "Eldest son of Ma Qi, grandson of Ma Haiyan, nephew to Ma Lin, brother to Ma Bufang and Ma Buying; cousin to Ma Zhongying.\nIt is this description which best describes the situation of Ma Buqing, and the Ma Jiajun (Ma Military Clique) as a whole. Born in 1898 in Gansu, he entered the world two years after his father founded the Xibei Guojia. Backed by the other Ma clans, Ma Qi quickly set about consolidation; building upon his relationships with the Yihewani sect of Sunni Islam, he appointed their leader Ma Wanfu and his most prominent followers as official advisors to the rulers, making it the state religion. Simultaneously, the name of the country was changed to emphasize its new religious nature - the Xibei Sultanate had been formed.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the new state suffered from all the problems the region had under the Qing, now exacerbated under the Hui governance of the Ma families. The Tibetans, Hui, Han, and a dozen more ethnic groups embroiled themselves in feuds that lasted generations and usually culminated in violence. These problems were particularly acute in the province of Shaanxi, opened to Hui settlement; while some families lived side by side peacefully, others could not release the ancient grudges.\nBy appointing family and other Ma clan members to gubernatorial positions, or provincial magistrates for younger or junior men, the country was bound together in a slapdash set of mutual connections. This changed, however, with Ma Qi's death in 1931; Ma Buqing was the eldest brother, but not the most powerful, yet he became leader anyway due to his primacy under only recently codified succession laws. Without the allies of his father or brothers, things could go poorly for him if he cannot compromise on the Sultanate's future..."

## Xinjiang
yang_zengxin_desc:0 "Born March 4, 1864, in Yunnan, Yang Zengxin has had what many might describe as a fortuitously uneventful life compared to his contemporaries - yet to describe this same life is to write about the entire modern history of Xinjiang. In 1888 he attained the jinshi rank, and despite his inexperience he was subsequently appointed as governor in 1890 with Wei Guangtao's retirement. Some whispered of secret payments to influential court officials, but his skill was undeniable even then. He showed expertise in both military and political spheres; he expanded Xinjiang Province's boundaries inside the Qing Empire, and fought off armies attempting to encroach upon the borderlands.\n\nWith the outbreak of the War of National Salvation in 1890, the same year as his appointment, Yang chose to adopt much the same policy that would serve him well in provincial administration: governance through inaction, or wuwei er zhi. Not declaring himself sovereign or aiding Beijing, he stayed apart from the chaos consuming the rest of the country. His officers were personally appointed and paid for by him; they had no ideas of national loyalty or protection. After the Qing concessions of 1894, he did declare Xinjiang sovereign and ruled it as a union of the peoples - suppressing them when any got too influential, and pitting them against each other to maintain peace.\n\nImportantly, however, Yang always maintained a monopoly on violence - all-out war was never permitted between the squabbling groups he ruled, part of his programs for a secure provincial peace. Corruption and bribery of officials was sharply punished; a story relates that he once announced to a room of local rulers that he would resign the next day. At once, they stood up and prevented him from leaving the hall - calling on him to stay, as the only person who could restrain their subordinates from slipping into self-enrichment.\nYang's rule has been exceedingly consequential in other matters, too: Mongolian forces have been repulsed, military expenditures cut nearly in half, textile factories opened, and administrative officials cleansed of corruption.\n\nTogether with his right hand Jin Shuren, and left hand Fan Yaonan, it seems like nothing can bring an end to Yang's leadership...except, perhaps, old age."

Old paths will no longer be sufficient to curb the political awareness of a growingly conscious population, and those who clung to them are fading. While it lasts, however, the curious arrangement he created is not without its benefits."

sugirbayev_desc:0 "Former Commander of the Kazakh National Army, now leader of the Ili Orda, Dalelkhan Sugirbayev was born on June 24th, 1906. As a local politician and cavalryman, he represented the interests of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to Yang's government. Well-known for supporting armed conflict rather than peaceful assertion of rights, he seized the opportunity with Yang's death and Jin's seizure of power to declare an independent nation. He received training in Russia and still has friends in Moscow, friends who are likely to make pleas for materiel in his name. Russians advise his military strategies, branding him a collaborator by some - but Sugirbayev remains steadfast, and has been inspired by their Central Asian governance in his domestic policies. Emphasizing military integration with all economic affairs, his ideal vision for the Orda requires a fusion between the army and the state that will empower citizens to defend it to the death.\n\nFor the moment, however, he would do well to cast aside these grand notions in favor of a more practical campaign against his many, many enemies."

Gathering about him his own group of trustworthy - though not necessarily skillful - advisors in imitation of Yang's governance style, a republic has been declared in Dihua. In practice, this is nothing but a facade for what approaches a military junta in method. Extracting heavy taxes on minorities, pouring funds into military development, and abolishing any local autonomies - no one who has seen Jin's work benefits from it.
