    southamerica.2.d:0 "Since the restoration of democracy in Brazil in 1895, politicians have solely attended to the interests of the elite and ignored the needs of the middle and working classes, who sought alternatives on the right, with fascism and nationalism, and on the left, with socialism and communism. The late 1920s and early 1930s saw different political factions prepare for a conflict that would come to start with the election of Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada in 1934. Before Antônio could be sworn in as president, a coup d'etat ended the First Brazilian Republic in an attempt to establish a Stratocracy. The various political factions — including the constitutionalists who defended the elected government — revolted against the military rule, beginning the Brazilian Civil War."

Yet, the many enemies on our border make this impossible. To the north, Brazil lies ravaged by civil war. We never know what might happen there. To our west and south, the Argentines present the biggest threat. They dare proclaim themselves the "Empire of the Sun", and hope to claim all of our nation. The Colorados and National Parties together signed the National Mobilization Act, despite the people being heavily against it. Our government has accepted the reality of our situation: we must defend Uruguay at all costs!"

The Germans might lie across the Atlantic, but maybe we are not so different after all."
