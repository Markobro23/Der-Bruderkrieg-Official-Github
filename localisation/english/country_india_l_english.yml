 RAJ_foreigners_in_a_distant_land:0 "Foreigners in a Distant Land"
 RAJ_foreigners_in_a_distant_land_desc:0 "Gone are the glory days of the Raj, the old haven of the British aristocracy. Instead, the Royal Indian Army finds itself a mostly British force composing, as satirical writer Eric Blair put it, “the world’s largest police force.” Our support from the natives is negligible, resistance is high, and most of our military and political assets right now are focused on preventing this last bastion from falling to the rebel horde. We are in no position to reconquer India for the Crown until we pacify our homebase first."
 RAJ_legacy_of_great_famine:0 "Legacy of the Great Famine"
 RAJ_legacy_of_great_famine_desc:0 "During the Indian Rebellion, food was requisitioned and Indian farmers were moved to the cities to produce guns for the Raj in the increasingly desperate fight. This resulted in a massive famine, which crippled what little land we have left. Nevertheless, thanks to forced labor programs, our industry remains mostly intact, despite the collapse of Indian agriculture in Bengal. The famine itself is over, but its scars will take a long time to heal."
 RAJ_reorganized_royal_indian_army:0 "Reorganized Royal Indian Army"
 RAJ_reorganized_royal_indian_army_desc:0 "The Royal Indian Army was a mess after the Revolution, with defections sweeping the ranks, and the only thing that saved even our tiny remnant was hundreds of thousands of regular British soldiers. Governor-General Auchinleck determined that this must never happen again, and reorganized the army to make it smaller, more reliable, and more effective, as neither us nor the homeland can ever field a mass army to match the revolutionaries. When we march to reclaim India, it will not be a disloyal, underequipped, and incompetent force, but the disciplined cream of the crop of the soldiers of British India."
 RAJ_zamindar_approval:0 "Zamindar Approval"
 RAJ_zamindar_approval_desc:0 "The only social group we can depend on for loyalty are the Zamindars, the wealthy aristocracy who own much of the land in the remaining British Raj. Their loyalty will last as long as we countinue to court them, and the threat of Bose's communists remains alive."
 #all india government
 AIG_india_forever:0 "Jai Hind!"
 AIG_india_forever_desc:0 "India has just freed itself from the oppressive British yoke. Though we may be bitterly divided, all Indians can agree that it must never happen again."
 AIG_recovering_from_war:0 "Recovering from the War"
 AIG_recovering_from_war_desc:0 "During the war, India was brutally devastated by the horrors of modern war. In particular, as the war culminated, the Anglos destroyed factories and dockyards to destroy our industrial machine, and their food requisitions and forced labor programs caused a famine. Furthermore, the lack of foreign trade and our transformation efforts towards a socialist economy have combined to leave our whole society in shambles, and this needs to be resolved before we can attempt unification and liberation."
 AIG_religious_tensions:0 "Religious Tensions"
 AIG_religious_tensions_desc:0 "After division and secession rocked the Indian cause, many Muslims felt more loyalty to Pakistan or to Patel’s government. Bose’s alliance of convenience with Hindutva nationalists akin to Bianchi’s Italy has not helped matters, and internecine violence is an increasingly common occurrence, which has bred cynicism and hatred of the government. In addition, Bose’s ally Bhimrao Ambedkar is spearheading the dismantling of the caste system, which has generated massive resistance at the local level by traditional leaders. We have to resolve all this to maintain internal unity, before we can unite and liberate the rest of India."
 AIG_anticolonial_association_oppressed_people:0 "The Anti-Colonial Association of Oppressed People"
 AIG_anticolonial_association_oppressed_people_desc:0 "The Provisional Government is a founding member of the AAOP, and we have prestige across the Asian continent and beyond for our successful struggle against colonialism. When we march against the British in Bengal and the Western occupations across the world, our brothers in Asia and Africa will surely stand with us."
 #indian national congress
 INC_legitimist_remnant:0 "The Legitimist Successor of India"
 INC_legitimist_remnant_desc:0 " The government in Bombay represents the legitimate Executive Committee, leaders of India until Bose’s coup. That being said, we are just a shadow of our former selves as most of India backed the tyrant in Delhi, and it will take a lot for us to reclaim our position as the rightful leaders of India."
 INC_professional_army:0 "Bharat's Roughriders"
 INC_professional_army_desc:0 "One of the few advantages we have over Delhi is the professionalism of our army. Most of the mutineers from the Raj’s army, as opposed to Bose’s mass army, backed our cause, as well as the ferocious Legion of Shivaji. Furthermore, our European connections have furnished us with new tactical information and knowledge of the Panzer. If we can strike fast, perhaps we can break the People’s Army."
 INC_weak_economy:0 "The Struggling Gujarat System"
 INC_weak_economy_desc:0 "The economy in our domains is not great, though Gujarat suffered comparatively little from the Revolution. However, we are considered an anti-socialist faction and one that Europeans can work with, and with help from investors our economy is not the basket case that is the provisional government. But much work remains to be done before our economy is functional again."
 #sikh empire
 KHA_khalsa:0 "Khalsa"
 KHA_khalsa_desc:0 "The Khalsa is the Sikh community ordained by the last human Guru, Gobind Singh. All of our people are trained warriors, and no army is our equal. We do not want war, but we will repel any who encroach on our new, pure nation."
 #kingdom of sindh
 PAK_moth_eaten_pakistan:0 "A Moth-Eaten Pakistan"
 PAK_moth_eaten_pakistan_desc:0 "When we rebelled against Bose, we expected that all Muslim lands in India would be under Pakistan. But military reality didn’t agree with us, and to protect what we had we sacrificed tens of millions of our brothers to Bose, his Sikh lackeys, Patel, and the Anglos. Territorial revisionism is widespread and is causing massive problems, and the people won’t be satisfied until all Muslims are free."
 PAK_moth_eaten_pakistan_2:0 "A Moth-Eaten Pakistan"
 PAK_moth_eaten_pakistan_2_desc:0 "When we rebelled against Bose, we expected that all Muslim lands in India would be under Pakistan. But military reality didn’t agree with us, and to protect what we had we sacrificed tens of millions of our brothers to Bose, his Sikh lackeys, Patel, and the Anglos. Territorial revisionism is widespread and is causing massive problems, and the people won’t be satisfied until all Muslims are free."

 PAK_memories_of_mughals:0 "Memories of the Mughals"
 PAK_memories_of_mughals_desc:0 "There are many in Pakistan who think fondly of the days of the Mughals, and look with fury at the oppression of our people by Bose and the other petty Hindu rulers. They believe that it is our duty to liberate them and rule India, as our ancestors once did. Their…patriotism is appreciated, so long as it doesn’t get out of hand…"
 #dravida
 DRA_good_times_just_around_corner:0 "Good Times Are Just Around The Corner"
 DRA_good_times_just_around_corner_desc:0 "Dravida’s saving grace is that it has the only reasonably decent economy in India. The independent states are a mess, blighted by war and famine, and the Raj remnant doesn’t care about its people. But with the help of our French backers, and with surprising unity in the government, we have revitalized the economy and are mostly recovered from the war. Things can only get better, as long as sudden instability doesn’t strike…"
 DRA_unionist_opposition:0 "Unionist Opposition"
 DRA_unionist_opposition_desc:0 "When the Chennai uprising began, our leader, Periyar Ramasamy, declared that the new government would stand for freedom from the oppressors in London and Delhi. And indeed, we now have freedom, and a lot of our people wish we didn’t. The dream of a united India still comes before the dream of a free Dravida in the hearts of many, especially given the ineffectiveness of the current government."
 DRA_unionist_opposition_2:0 "Unionist Opposition"
 DRA_unionist_opposition_2_desc:0 "When the Chennai uprising began, our leader, Periyar Ramasamy, declared that the new government would stand for freedom from the oppressors in London and Delhi. And indeed, we now have freedom, and a lot of our people wish we didn’t. The dream of a united India still comes before the dream of a free Dravida in the hearts of many, especially given the ineffectiveness of the current government."
 DRA_most_confused_government_in_history:0 "''The Most Confused Government in History''"
 DRA_most_confused_government_in_history_desc:0 "The French Foreign Minister, on his arrival here, coined this term in a leaked dispatch to the government, and it has stuck. President Ramasamy may be the president, but he shares power with the Council of State - made up of princes, commercial interests, and traditionalists. Ramasamy and the Council hate each other and only the lack of desire - and ability - for another conflict have kept both from resolving the dispute by arms. Adding to this, Ramasamy’s anti-castist campaign - his defining belief - is either overapplied or not applied at all.\n\nDravida’s legal system is also a mess thanks to the lack of unity between the various Princely States and what little land is truly ruled by the federal government. And then there are those who are actively, violently opposed to Dravida as a state - the unionists, the Anglo remnants who failed to evacuate, the communists, and the mob - because at any place, given a few months, there will have been a mob riot at some point. No one can actually change this situation thanks to vested interests, but if things don’t get substantially better the Dravidian dream will die a cruel death."

With British support, we established a republic and exiled the opressive Wangchuck to Tibet. Despite our alliance with Long Yun, a return to Tibet seems far off with our current military situation.
